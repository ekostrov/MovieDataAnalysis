    "I will perform an analysis on a large data set of movies.  The data includes many different types of information about each movie, such as the release date, the budget, the box office earnings domestic and worldwide, and genres. I will analyze this data set to determine what contributes to a movie being a “success”.  For this analysis, I will define success in the terms of profit, basing the success of a movie on the amount of money it earns in comparison to the movie’s budget."

    "As the demand for new, original content grows, in part due to the rise of streaming platforms such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Disney+, and others producing original movies and television shows, so too does the need for comprehensive analytics about what makes a movie successful. With the ever growing demand for new movies and the wide range of movie genres, analytics about the performance of movies can give useful information to studios so that they can make the most strategic decisions regarding production and financing. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each year, the entertainment industry produces more movies, bigger movies, and more types of media compete for audience attention. Between 2000 and 2010, just 36% of movies had profitable box-office returns. So missing the mark is more costly than ever, and your every decision takes more into account. Success hinges on your professional experience and the industry insights of those around you. In all, it is a pretty closed system with a lot of opportunity for subjective interpretation.\n",
